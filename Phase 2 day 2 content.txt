POLYMORPHISM:one item or same item use for different purpose

TYPES:
1. overloading
   a.operator overloading
   b.method overloading
2. overriding
 
operator overloading:the "+" operator used for integer additon as well as string concatination.
method overloading:add() method is used to take 1 more arguments in the same program.

OVERRIDING:
if a method is defective or cannot be used inside derived class it will take it from
base class or parent class

DATA STRUCTURE IN PYTHON:
-helps to write efficient programs
-linear-arrays,linked lists,stacks,queue,matrix
-non-linear-binary tree,heap,hush tables,graphs
-linear-storing data sequentially
-non-linear-non sequestial style required
 
STATIC:-array(size is fixed)
DYNAMIC:-list,stack,queue(size is mutable)

LINKED LIST:real time example train
as the name says list of item which are linked with one another knowns as linked lists.
 
TYPES OF LINKED LIST:
-singly
-doubly
-circular

CREATING LINKED LIST:
step 1:create the node 
step 2:partition the node the 2 segments data and none
step 3:add valy=ue into the blank node
step 4:mark the node as head
step 5:create the next node by following the above steps
step 6:establish the link between node1 and node2

DISPLAY LINKED LIST:
traversal is required from first node till til node in order to display existing linked list
