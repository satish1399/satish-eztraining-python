LAMBDA FUNCTION:Its called as anonymous function.when we want to use function concept alone without using function name there we apply the concept of lambda function.

Four pillars of OOPS:

1.Abstraction
2.Encapsulation
3.Interitance
4.Polymorphism

Hiding the implementation part showing what is required for the users is called as Abstraction.
Example:exe file.

We can make class or method as abstract ,oppisite to abstract is concrete.


Encapsulation:binding data and function into a singke entity.

public: one class info can be accessed by any other class.

private:can be used where it is declared/no in inheritected class.

protected:can be accessed only where it got declared whichever class inherited from this class there also we use.

a->public
_b->protected
_ _c->private

Interitance:base class and derived class.

derived class will inherit properties of base class.

Base class-parent class.
Derived class-child class.

Types of inheritance:

1.Single inheritance
2.multiple inheritance
3.multi level inheritance
4.hirerical inheritance
5.hybrid inheritance
